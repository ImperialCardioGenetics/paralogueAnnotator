# paralogueAnnotator

The repository is the home of an ensembl VEP plug in for genomic DNA variation.  Given details of a variant, the plug-in determines whether variation has been previously observed at an equivalent position in other members of the protein family.  If so, details of the variants in paralogues are returned, including phenotypic annotations.  This approach has been shown to identify human disease-associated variants across protein families.

See http://cardiodb.org/Paralogue_Annotation/ for an overview of the approach, with specific applications to inherited cardiac conditions.
